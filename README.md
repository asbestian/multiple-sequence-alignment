About
-----
This repository contains code to solve the multiple sequence alignment problem 
via a branch-and-cut approach. 

The mathematical model and separation routines follow the description
of
[A branch-and-cut algorithm for multiple sequence alignment](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-005-0659-3) by
Althaus et al.

A technical report about this implementation can be found in [doc/tech\_report.pdf](doc/tech_report.pdf).
